# Hi there, I'm Skaikru_ / Dante0518 👋

I’m embarking on an exciting journey into the world of **full-stack development**, starting strong with frontend development.  
For me, programming is more than just a career goal—it's a passion and a hobby that fuels my creativity.

I’m drawn to modern, minimalistic designs that are both visually stunning and fully responsive across all devices. My aim is to build **intuitive**, **aesthetically pleasing**, and **user-friendly** web experiences.

As an **open-minded** and **fast learner**, I'm constantly experimenting with new tools and techniques. Let’s create something extraordinary together! 🚀
